# HW5-Day_Planner

This project is a calendar app that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by typing into description boxes. This app is deployed through github pages.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and when the user scrolls down, timeblocks for standard business hours are available.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present or future.

Additionally, when a timeblock is clicked on, the user can enter and event and use the save button to save their event in local storage.

When the page is refreshed, events persist.
